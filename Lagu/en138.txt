Let's Get It On

I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feelin' for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then come on, oh come on
Whoo, let's get it on, ah baby
Let's get it on, let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on, whoo-ooh-ooh
We're all sensitive people
With so much to give, understanding, sugar
Since we got to be
Let's live, I love you
There's nothing wrong with me
Lovin' you, baby no no
And givin' yourself to me could never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful
Life can be?
I'm asking you baby
To get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry
I ain't gonna push, I won't push you baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Let's get it on
Let's get it on, you know what I'm talkin' about
Come on baby, hey hey, let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on, let's get it on, baby
This minute, oh yeah
Let's get it on, please
Please get it on
I know that you know what I've been dreaming of
Don't you baby?
My whole body wants the feeling of love
Ah help me!
I ain't gonna worry,
No I ain't gonna push, I won't push you baby
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on darlin'
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Oh, gonna get it on, threatening you, baby
I want to get it on, you don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves you, let me groove you
Good, let your love come down, oh, get it on
Come on baby
Do you know the meaning of being sanctified?
Ah...
Girl, you give me good feelings
So good, something like sanctifying
Oh, do right baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you wanna love me baby
Just let yourself go
Oh, baby, let's get it on
