Eyes On You

As I fix my eyes on You
All my trouble seems so far away
You have come and saved the day
I know I'm alive
I know I'm alive
In You now I'll stand my ground
For I know Your Word will never fail
I will raise and dream again
Soaring in Your love
Soaring in Your love
I'll sing my praise to the heavens
Jesus my savior
Jesus my savior
I'll lift my hands to the heavens
Jesus my savior
Jesus my savior
Your love the greatest love
I set my eyes above
You never give up on me
You never give up on me
Your love the greatest love
I set my eyes above
You never give up on me
You never give up on me
In You now I'll stand my ground
For I know Your Word will never fail
I will raise and dream again
Soaring in Your love
Soaring in Your love
I'll sing my praise to the heavens
Jesus my savior

I'll lift my hands to the heavens
