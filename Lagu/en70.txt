Cool

I'm feeling so cool
Top to the bottom, just cool
Every little thing that I do
Dammit, I'm feelin' so cool, yeah
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year, yeah
Standin' there with the red dress on you
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me, or am I just havin' a good year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
Dammit, I feel so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so cool (cool)
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winnin' like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (do)
Dammit, I feel so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feelin' so cool
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old-school Sheen
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (cool)
Every little thing that I do (I do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so cool
It's like, ooh (ooh)
Maybe I should bottle my moves (moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feelin' so cool
(Hey, hey, hey)
Cool
