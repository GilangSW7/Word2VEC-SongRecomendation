You Were Meant For Me

I hear the clock, it's six a.m.
I feel so far from where I've been
I got my eggs and my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup, everything but you
I break the yolks, make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
I wipe the spots off the mirror
Don't leave the keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you'll see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I called my momma, she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't want to talk
So I pick up the paper, it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie, it just was wasn't the same
'Cause it was happy and I was sad
It made me miss you oh so bad
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon you'll see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
I go about my business
I'm doin' fine
Besides what would I say
If I had you on the line
Same old stort, not much to say
Hearts are broken, everyday
I brush my teeth and put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick up a book, turn the sheets down
Take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my p.j's and hop into bed
I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try to tell myself it'll be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight
Dreams last for so long
Even after you're gone
I know you love me
And soon I know you'll see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
Yeah...
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you
