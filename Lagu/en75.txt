Girls Need Love

Honestly
Honestly, I'm tryna stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now
Better swing my way
I just need some dick
I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas baby
I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug aye
You could be the one aye
We could start with a handshake baby
I'ma need more than a hug
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now oh now
Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason baby
I wanna take and find
I can give it to you right babe oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Aye, I need some love
Aye, I need some love
Aye, I need some love
Aye, and you can't judge
Girls need love too (yeah)
Girls, girls need love too
Girls need love (let me tell you something)
Girls need love (girls need loving too)
Girls need love too
Girls need love too (So what's a girl to do)
Girls need love too (When she needs loving too)
Girls, girls need love too
