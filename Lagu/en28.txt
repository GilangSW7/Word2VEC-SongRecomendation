Whiskey Glasses

Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell no
I just want to sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more, let's go
'Cause I ain't ever hurt like this before
Don't wanna think about her
Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause, brother, she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
I ain't drunk dialing no more at 3am
Mr. Bartender, hit me again
Don't wanna think about her
Wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause, brother, she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
See the world through whiskey glasses, yeah
