Worth It

Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the ocean
Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the sky
Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the ocean
Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the sky
Making scene of fairy tale was it worthy?
White love in the drawing sand make it worth it
Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the ocean
Are you coming baby eyes
It takes two to do the sky
I build the high fortress you take polaroid
I watch the halo moon you slow down the road
Are you coming baby eyes
Are you coming baby eyes
Are you coming baby eyes
Are you coming baby eyes
Are you coming baby eyes
Are you coming baby eyes
