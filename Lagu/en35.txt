Envy Me

Now I lay down to sleep (Now I lay down to sleep)
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep (yeah)
Like a locksmith, I got the keys (yeah)
Pull up make opp niggas bleed (aye)
I got water like overseas, yeah (aye)
Bitch, I ball like NBA, yeah (aye)
Bitch, I ball like MVP, yeah (aye)
I got money, they envy me
I'm with the gang
I'm with the mob, what was you thinking
Remember them days
And that shit was hard, a nigga been thinking
I put a four in a 20 ounce, a nigga been drinking
If you with the squad
I give you my heart, lil nigga, I mean it
I was fighting some demons
In the field, bitch, I'm deep in
I was raised in the deep end
I know niggas be sinking
Take your bitch and go deep in
But I gave her back, why you tweaking
Come around with that rah-rah
We leave you dead on the cement
With the gang, we ain't playing fair
Matter fact, we don't play at all
OG woods in the air
But we bought the Runtz so we smoke it all
Putting on a front, boy, you better fall
We gone kill em, yeah, we gone kill em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bend with it in my draws
Hit that smoke and I'm blacking
Hit that smoke and I black out
If he run, blow his back down
I was gone but I'm back now
These niggas gone fold
But I never back down
In the school, I was trapping
In the school, you was class clown
Now I lay down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep (yeah)
Like a locksmith, I got the keys (yeah)
Pull up make opp niggas bleed (aye)
I got water like overseas, yeah (aye)
Bitch, I ball like NBA, yeah (aye)
Bitch, I ball like MVP, yeah (aye)
I got money, they envy me
