I Love Rock 'N Roll

I saw him dancin' there by the record machine
I knew he must have been about 17
The beat was going strong, playing my favorite song
And I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with me
Yeah me
And I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with me
Yeah me
Singin'
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
He smiles so I got up and asked for his name
but that don't matter he said it's all the same
I said can I take ya home, where we can be alone
And next we were moving on and he was with me
Yeah me
And next we were moving on and he was with me
Yeah me
Singin'
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
I said can I take ya home where we can be alone
Next we're moving on and he was with me
Yeah me
and we'll be moving on and singing that same old song
Yeah with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
I love rock and roll
So put another dime in the jukebox baby
I love rock and roll
So come on take some time and dance with me
